The application detects hand gestures indicating the numbers 1, 2, or 3, and selects the corresponding ingredient accordingly.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and recognize hand gestures.
- Ingredient selection: Based on the detected hand gesture, the application selects the corresponding ingredient for the cafe order.
- Streamlined ordering process: By using hand gestures, the application simplifies the process of selecting ingredients, making it efficient and convenient.
